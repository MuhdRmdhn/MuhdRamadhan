            I love traveling because it allows me to explore new cultures, meet different people, and experience the world from various perspectives. Whether it's discovering hidden gems in a foreign city or immersing myself in nature, traveling fuels my curiosity and keeps me inspired. It broadens my horizons and challenges me to step out of my comfort zone.

            Theatre has always been a passion of mine, as it combines creativity, storytelling, and performance. I enjoy attending plays, musicals, and other live performances, as they offer a unique and immersive form of entertainment. Theatre not only inspires my creativity but also teaches me the importance of collaboration and dedication in bringing stories to life.
